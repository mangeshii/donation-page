                    Save the Children is India’s leading independent child
                    rights’ NGO, which works in 18 states of the country.
                    Beginning its journey in 2008 in India, and registered as
                    ‘Bal Raksha Bharat’, we have changed the lives of more than
                    11 million (1.1 crore) children. We firmly believe that
                    every child deserves the best chance for a bright future,
                    which is why, we are fiercely committed to ensure that
                    children not only survive, but thrive. With a bold ambition
                    and a powerful vigilance, we do whatever it takes to save
                    the children. In India and across the world, Save the
                    Children works on-ground – every day and especially, in
                    times of crisis. Our pioneering programs address children’s
                    unique needs; giving them a healthy start, an opportunity to
                    learn as well as protection from harm. When crisis strikes,
                    we are always among the first to respond and the last to
                    leave. We are the outspoken champions for children, ensuring
                    that their voices are heard and their issues are given top
                    priority. Drawing on a century of leading expertise, we take
                    on the toughest challenges, facing the hardest-to-reach
                    children – especially those unfairly excluded from the
                    world’s progress. We are proud to be the world’s leading
                    expert on children, delivering lasting results to millions
                    of vulnerable girls and boys. By saving our world’s
                    children, we transform their lives and the future we share.
                    While we run several programmes across India, we also work
                    in tandem with numerous government agencies, civil society
                    organizations, and communities across five core themes:
                    Health & Nutrition, Education, Child Protection,
                    Humanitarian Response, as well as Disaster Risk Reduction
                    and Child Poverty. Aligned with Save the Children’s Global
                    Breakthroughs for 2030, we strive to build a world where
                    every child attains the right to survival, protection,
                    development and participation.
